# Automation of the enrollment process in courses

Due to the approval of new changes in the study modalities of Course by Encounters (CPE) and Distance Education (EaD), the University of Havana (UH) has received applicants in these modalities in recent years. The number of applicants has exceeded 3,000 figures in all the time these changes have been implemented.

Therefore, the process of managing enrollment and managing entrance exams becomes complex due to the number of applicants who apply. In addition, the number of personnel entering the UH during registration and exams is high and poses a problem for the safety and performance of center workers.

Due to the aforementioned, it is necessary to design, implement and deploy a system that provides improvements to the management of the applicants' registration, and provides specific reports about this management.

## The System

The system, in its conception, offers the possibility of being able to create a registration request, which will collect the data of the applicants, including the approval of the Affidavit. This form can be filled out by the applicant from outside the center, prepared from the center itself or by authorized personnel at the UH, in the presence of the applicant.

The preparation of this registration has a period that must be established by those responsible for this activity and taking into account the date on which each of the applications is made, it will serve to establish dates automatically. Applicants will go to the center to formalize their registration, choosing between the scheduled shifts or using the one assigned by the system.

At the time of registration validation, a classroom will be automatically assigned from those available for the applicant to take the exam. When the registrations have finished, the system will generate a document that will contain a list with the name of the applicants and the classroom where they will be examined.
Once the exams have been graded, the designated secretary must enter the grades into the system. At the required time, the races will be awarded automatically. With regard to the granting of majors, the students will be ordered by note and the majors will be distributed in order of priority. The races do not have a fixed number of places, that is, if two students have the same grade and are opting for a single place, the system will create two places.

At the end of the process, the system will also automatically generate three documents, a list that for each applicant will have the degree assigned. The second document will contain the closing note of the races whose places have been exhausted and the last document will have a list with information on all the remaining races.
